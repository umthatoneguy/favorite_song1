      <p id="header">
        "Bound for the Floor" by Local H, released in 1996 as the lead single from their album "As Good as Dead," 
        showcases the band's signature 1990s alternative rock style with its distinctive guitar riff and energetic 
        sound. The song achieved significant airplay on both modern rock and mainstream rock radio stations, propelling 
        it to No. 5 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and No. 10 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Lyrically, 
        the song captures themes of disillusionment and frustration, resonating deeply with the grunge and alternative 
        rock scene of its era. Local H, comprised of Scott Lucas on guitar and vocals and Joe Daniels on drums, garnered 
        widespread recognition and acclaim with this track, solidifying its place as one of their most popular and enduring songs.
